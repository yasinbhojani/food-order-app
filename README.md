# food-order-app

a simple and functional food ordering app.

hosted link: [foodorderapp-yb.netlify.app](https://foodorderapp-yb.netlify.app/)

I made this food order app as a practice project while learning react hooks and context API. This app mainly uses a context and a reducer to manage the data. This project is still a work in progress and there are more functionalities to be added.
